# Epicenter!!!!!

Natural disasters often devastate the communities that are struck by them. After seeing how the recent winter storm has affected Texas, we built a web application that allows Texans and other surrounding Southerners to locate shelters, warming centers, service, food/water and other necessities. The application also gives users immediate sources to find the latest news concerning the weather, current situations, and smart hacks to get through power outages and survive natural disasters. It also gives everyone the ability to advertise what they might have in abundance, and share resources to their community. CodeCoet's future plans for Epicenter are to have it go global, so that communities around the world who suffer from the effects of natural disasters can respond to them quicker and more efficiently.
